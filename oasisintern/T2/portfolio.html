                <h3>An Automated Chronic Disease Management System for Cardiac Arrest Detection and Prevention on Emergency using
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)</h3>
                <p>One of the most important aspects of human life is health, particularly for senior citizens and all human beings. It is an essential component of living a sustainable life. IoT (Internet of Medical Things) plays a fascinating role in automation and monitoring in this modern era. It is an innovative way of amalgamating medical devices and healthcare applications, which include cloud-based platforms, applications, and devices that will bring together volumes of discrete data from various sources and process such data. However, it is very complex and difficult to maintain/monitor health conditions all the time in physical mode, especially at night and while traveling. If a senior citizen or patient suffers from health problems such as sudden cardiac arrest or a rise/fall in blood pressure levels in their body, it will be extremely difficult to obtain immediate assistance from others as well as medical agencies.  The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an important and recent technological advancement, and method for achieving remote healthcare monitoring, where secure and efficient medical data retrieval is critical. The proposed method automatically monitors heart beat rate by employing a pulse sensor and for Blood Pressure (BP) MEMS pressure sensor is built into IoMT devices. If a senior citizen suffers a cardiac arrest, an automatic call is enabled to nearby ambulance service and their caretakers with the exact GPS location. The advantage of the proposed method is it prevents sudden death or serious illness due to heart disease and can also be easily monitored by sending text messages with their heartbeat rate as a daily report to caregiver.</p>

                <h3>Lung Cancer Prediction and Classification based on correlation selection method using Machine Learning Techniques
                </h3>
                <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Early detection and treatment are essential for improving patient outcomes. We proposed Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict and classify lung cancer. In this paper, we proposed ANNs for lung cancer prediction and classification. We discuss the different types of ANNs that have been used for this task, as well as the different data sources that have been used to train and evaluate ANN models. We also present some of the most promising results that have been achieved with ANNs for lung cancer prediction and classification.
